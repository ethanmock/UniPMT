## To get the trained model file

Since the models are large, you can download the trained models from the `model/` folder on the google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ht6OBhv34LrZBm9Y2ow_A3KkuAk8tmG?usp=sharing).

Put the downloaded models inside this folder, e.g., `./model_pmt_pmt.pt/`.
